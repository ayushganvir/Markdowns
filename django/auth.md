# Authentication

Handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. Handles both authentication and authorization.

The auth system consists of:

1. Users
2. Permissions: Binary (yes/no) flags designating whether a user may perform a certain task.
3. Groups: A generic way of applying labels and permissions to more than one user.
4. A configurable password hashing system
5. Forms and view tools for logging in users, or restricting content
6. A pluggable backend system

## Installation

Consist of two items listed in your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

1. 'django.contrib.auth' contains the core of the authentication framework, and its default models.
2. 'django.contrib.contenttypes' is the Django content type system, which allows permissions to be associated with models you create.

Middlewares :
1. SessionMiddleware
2. AuthenticationMiddleware

## User Objects
Has fields :
1. username
2. password
3. email
4. first_name
5. last_name

## Creating User
The most direct way to create users is to use the included create_user() / createsuperuser  helper function.

## Passwords
Django does not store raw (clear text) passwords on the user model, but only a hash.
Changing passwords programmatically can be done by the helper function set_password():

```python
u = User.objects.get(username='john')
u.set_password('new password')
```
Django provides a flexible password storage system and uses PBKDF2 by default.

Password is saved as:
```python
<algorithm>$<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>
```
You can use different password hashers defined in settings.py
```python
PASSWORD_HASHERS = [
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',

]
```
## Authenticating users
```python
authenticate(request=None, **credentials)Â¶
```
## Permissions and authorization

Django comes with a built-in permissions system. It provides a way to assign permissions to specific users and groups of users.

Permissions can be set not only per type of object, but also per specific object instance. By using the has_view_permission(), has_add_permission(), has_change_permission() and has_delete_permission() methods provided by the ModelAdmin class, it is possible to customize permissions for different object instances of the same type.


### Programmatically creating permissions
```python
from myapp.models import BlogPost
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(BlogPost)
permission = Permission.objects.create(
    codename='can_publish',
    name='Can Publish Posts',
    content_type=content_type,
)
```
