# MongoDB Basics
MongoDB stores data as JSON documents.

The fields in a JSON document can vary from document to document. Compare that to a traditional relational database table, where adding a field means adding a column to the database table itself and therefore to every record in the database.

Documents can be nested to express hierarchical relationships and to store structures such as arrays.

## Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS
* Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.

* Structure of a single object is clear.

* No complex joins.

* Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.

* Tuning.

* Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.

* Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.

* Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.
